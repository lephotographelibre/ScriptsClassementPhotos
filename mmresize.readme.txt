I hear all sorts of preferences for indexing, organizing and importing images in Linux. Ive tried almost all of them. What I find myself using more and more is just the Dolphin File manager. It may seem less functional than something like DigiKam, but i dont like the database structure of DigiKam and all of the text file litter it creates. Not to mention that I dont care for it as a raw editor at all. What Ive found myself doing more and more is using Dolphin in split pane with a terminal open at the bottom. One pane open to the card i am importing from, another to the folder I am importing to. If you shoot in RAW+small jpg, you can preview all the images and drag and drop into the folder without having to import all of them. Ive also started using ImageMagick alot in the terminal. ImageMagick is amazing for fast bulk processing. If I am in a folder of edited images, and I want to create a folder of resized copies for social media, I can create a bash script with:

mkdir mmsized && cp *.jpg ./mmsized && cd mmsized && mogrify scale 30% *.jpg && mogrify sharpen 1 *.jpg

Name the script mmresize, and then i can call it in the terminal whenever you need it. It will create a new folder of rescaled images reduced to 30% of their original size, and add a super subtle sharpening after the resize. Just enough to bring the focus back in eyes, etc. This is just scratching the surface with Image Magick. You can do green channel extractions for better black and white conversions, all sorts of things. You can of course do that in GIMP, but with Imagemagick you can do 300 images in about 30 seconds. Not sure how useful everyone else will find this, but as im starting to learn how to use the command line more Im realizing how much faster it can make my workflow.
